# Predictive Analytics Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow, starting from raw data analysis to building, evaluating, and comparing predictive models. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from data and develop a reliable model using structured machine learning practices.

The project is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook and follows a clean, modular, and reproducible approach suitable for real-world ML applications.
